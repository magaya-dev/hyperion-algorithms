# Hyperion-Algorithms - Base Algorithms for Hyperion

## Building blocks for Hyperion

Hyperion-Algorithms offers a set of functions for working with hyperion lists and working with documents.

```js
const Algorithms = require('hyperion-algorithms');
const connection = require('{get hyperion somehow}');

const algo = new Algorithms(connection.async);

algo.select(connection.hyperion.dbx.using(connection.hyperion.dbx.Shipping.Booking.ListByTime), 10)
    .where(booking => booking.GUID !== undefined)
    .project(booking => ({
        id: booking.GUID,
        createdOn: new Date(booking.CreatedOn)
    }))
    .then(bookings => console.log(bookings.length));
```

## Algorithms
Hyperion-Algorithms offers the following set of methods to work with cursors:

- [forEach](#forEach) - Used to iterate through a cursor, does not return anything, but will execute function for each element.
- [transform](#transform) - Used to transform individual elements in cursor into different representation. Returns transformed collection.
- [accumulate](#accumulate) - Used to obtain a single result from iterating a cursor. Can be used for sums and other reductions.
- [anyOf](#anyOf) - Returns true if at least one item returned by cursor matches predicate.
- [allOf](#allOf) - Returns true if all items returned by cursor matches predicate.
- [noneOf](#noneOf) - Returs true if no items returned by cursor match predicate.
- [find](#find) - Returns first item that matches predicate.
- [findFirst](#findFirst) - Returns first element in the cursor, no predicate.
- [collect](#collect) - Iterates the entire cursor and returns array of all elements that match predicate.
- [select](#select) - Used to obtain and transform a specific number of elements. Works like collect but will only iterate as far as needed to get the requested number of elements. 

## Attachments
Hyperion-Algorithms offers the following set of methods to work with attachments and documents:

- [streamAttachmentContent](#Attachments-and-Documents) - Used to retrieve an individual attachment (picture, video, etc.) from Magaya.
- [streamDocumentContent](#Attachments-and-Documents) - Used to retrieve a document (different from attachment) generated by Magaya in PDF format.

Both of these methods are meant to work with [Writable Streams](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v12.x/api/stream.html#stream_writable_streams) and as such expect a [write method](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v12.x/api/stream.html#stream_writable_write_chunk_encoding_callback) to exist. Data will always be sent in [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v12.x/api/buffer.html) format.

## Examples

### forEach
---
```js
// Continuation pattern
algo.forEach(dbx.using(dbx.Shipping.Booking.ListByTime))
    .callback(booking => {
        doSomethingWith(booking);
    })
    .then(() => {
        // forEach does not return anything 
        console.log('done!');
    });

// Async/Await pattern
await algo.forEach(dbx.using(dbx.Shipping.Booking.ListByTime))
    .callback(booking => {
        doSomethingWith(booking);
    });

// forEach does not return anything 
console.log('done!');
```

            created: new Date(booking.CreatedOn)
            status: booking.Status
        };
    })
    .then(bookings => {
        // We have an array of the transformed bookings
        bookings.forEach(b => console.log(b.creator));
    });

        // sent in the next iteration
        return total += booking.TotalWeight; 
    })
    .then(totalWeight => {
        // The final result of the accumulation
        console.log(totalWeight);

// seldom used but may be useful in some scenarios
algo.select(dbx.using(dbx.Shipping.Booking.ListByTime), 10)
    .preProject(true) // We want to apply 'where' to non-hyperion object
